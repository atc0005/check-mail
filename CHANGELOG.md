## [v0.2.6] - 2020-10-06

Follow-up binary release built using Go 1.15.2, cgo explicitly disabled. See
GH-101 for more details.

### Changed

- Add `-trimpath` build flag
  - intended to help prune verbose/unnecessary details from output

### Fixed

- Makefile build options generate static binaries which *potentially* bundle
  glibc (LGPL license)
  - I have been unable to confirm this, so attempting to "play it safe"
  - the goal is to avoid attaching the LGPL license to this project until I've
    properly researched and understand the ramifications of doing so for this
    project, for future forks, etc.

## [v0.2.5] - 2020-10-03

### Added

- First (limited) binary release
  - built using Go 1.15.2
    - see GH-94 and GH-95
  - windows
    - x86
    - x64
  - linux
    - x86
    - x64

### Changed

- Dependencies
  - built using Go 1.15.2
    - see GH-94 and GH-95
  - `atc0005/go-nagios`
    - `v0.4.0` to `v0.5.1`
  - `rs/zerolog`
    - `v1.19.0` to `v1.20.0`

    - `v2.3.2` to `v2.3.3`
  - `actions/setup-node`
    - `v2.1.1` to `v2.1.2`

- Move `config`, `mailboxes` code into subpackages

- `ReturnNagiosResults` deferred first, allowed to run last (as intended) to
  handle setting final exit code
  - this was changed to match new functionality added in `atc0005/go-nagios`
    dependency

### Fixed

- Makefile build options do not generate static binaries
- Typo in CHANGELOG release date format
- Makefile generates checksums with qualified path
- Failure to initialize application configuration at startup; "Error
  validating configuration: one or more folders not provided" message printed

## [v0.2.4] - 2020-08-31

### Changes

- Dependencies
  - upgrade `atc0005/go-nagios`
    - `v0.3.1` to `v0.4.0`

- Integration changes to replace custom check results handling with
  functionality provided by `v0.4.0` of the `atc0005/go-nagios` package

## [v0.2.3] - 2020-08-23

### Added

- Docker-based GitHub Actions Workflows
  - Replace native GitHub Actions with containers created and managed through
    the `atc0005/go-ci` project.

  - New, primary workflow
    - with parallel linting, testing and building tasks
    - with three Go environments
      - "old stable"
      - "stable"
      - "unstable"
    - Makefile is *not* used in this workflow
    - staticcheck linting using latest stable version provided by the
      `atc0005/go-ci` containers

  - Separate Makefile-based linting and building workflow
    - intended to help ensure that local Makefile-based builds that are
      referenced in project README files continue to work as advertised until
      a better local tool can be discovered/explored further
    - use `golang:latest` container to allow for Makefile-based linting
      tooling installation testing since the `atc0005/go-ci` project provides
      containers with those tools already pre-installed
      - linting tasks use container-provided `golangci-lint` config file
        *except* for the Makefile-driven linting task which continues to use
        the repo-provided copy of the `golangci-lint` configuration file

  - Add Quick Validation workflow
    - run on every push, everything else on pull request updates
    - linting via `golangci-lint` only
    - testing
    - no builds

- Add new README badges for additional CI workflows
  - each badge also links to the associated workflow results

### Changed

- Disable `golangci-lint` default exclusions

- dependencies
  - `go.mod` Go version
    - updated from `1.13` to `1.14`
  - `actions/setup-go`
    - updated from `v2.1.0` to `v2.1.2`
      - since replaced with Docker containers
  - `actions/setup-node`
    - updated from `v2.1.0` to `v2.1.1`
  - `actions/checkout`
    - updated from `v2.3.1` to `v2.3.2`

- README
  - Link badges to applicable GitHub Actions workflows results

- Linting
  - Local
    - `Makefile`
      - install latest stable `golangci-lint` binary instead of using a fixed
          version
  - CI
    - remove repo-provided copy of `golangci-lint` config file at start of
      linting task in order to force use of Docker container-provided config
      file

## [v0.2.2] - 2020-07-05

### Changed

- Dependencies
  - `actions/setup-go`
    - `v2.0.3` to `v2.1.0`
  - `actions/setup-node`
    - `v2.0.0` to `v2.1.0`
  - `atc0005/go-nagios`
    - `v0.2.0` to `v0.3.0`

- Replace hard-coded status strings with const refs
  - New in `v0.3.0` of `atc0005/go-nagios`

- Fix exit code references
  - These have changed as of `v0.3.0` of `atc0005/go-nagios`

- Minor README tweaks
  - Fix path to generated binaries
  - Markdown VSCode extension (`yzhang.markdown-all-in-one`) auto-fixes to ToC

## [v0.2.1] - 2020-06-23

### Added

- Enable Dependabot updates
  - Go Modules
  - GitHub Actions

### Changed

- Dependencies
  - `rs/zerolog`
    - `v1.18.0` to `v1.19.0`
  - `emersion/go-imap`
    - `v1.0.4` to `v1.0.5`
  - `actions/setup-go`
    - `v1` to `v2.0.3`
  - `actions/checkout`
    - `v1` to `v2.3.1`
  - `actions/setup-node`
    - `v1` to `v2.0.0`
  - `golangci-lint`
    - `1.25.0` to `v1.27.0`

## [v0.2.0] - 2020-04-28

### Changed

- Use common `cmd` subdirectory structure in order to more easily support
  multiple binaries

- Vendor dependencies

- Update Makefile and helper shell scripts
  - include `-mod=vendor` build flag for applicable `go` commands to reflect
    Go 1.13 vendoring
    - this includes specifying `-mod=vendor` even for `go list` commands,
        which unless specified results in dependencies being downloaded, even
        when they're already provided in a local, top-level `vendor` directory

- Update GitHub Actions Workflows
  - Disable running `go get` after checking out code
  - Exclude `vendor` folder from ...
    - Markdown linting checks
    - tests
    - basic build
  - Echo Go version used for CI runs
  - Update Go versions used
    - Remove Go 1.12 (no longer supported)
    - Add Go 1.14 (recent release)

- Dependencies
  - Update rs/zerolog to v1.18.0
  - Update emersion/go-imap to v1.0.4

- Linting
  - Move golangci-lint settings to external file
  - Add scopelint golangci-lint linter
  - Use golangci-lint binary instead of building src
  - Replace external shell scripts by incorporating applicable commands
    directly into the Makefile
  - Disable gofmt, golint external commands, rely on golangci-lint for that
    linting functionality

- Documentation
  - Update README to reflect recent updates to build process/layout

## [v0.1.2] - 2020-02-06

### Fixed

- Update status output to reflect the same format used in the original Python
  2 plugin.
  - For reasons I've yet to spend sufficient time to figure out, the
    double-quoting used for elements of the "folders" list is lost when sent
    by Teams or email notifications. It is easier to go ahead and just revert
    the format for now so it is consistent in each format (console, Teams or
    email).

## [v0.1.1] - 2020-02-06

### Fixed

- Branding output (app name, version) was only shown for application error
  conditions. This has been adjusted so that it is intentionally not shown by
  default for any condition, but can be toggled on via a new `-branding` flag.
- README example

## [v0.1.0] - 2020-02-04

Initial release!

This release provides an early release version of a Nagios plugin used to
monitor IMAP mailboxes for content. This plugin (or its predecessor as of this
writing) is used to monitor email accounts scraped by our ticketing system.

Future releases of this project are expected to shift directory structure and
content in order to accommodate additional Nagios plugins and tools used to
monitor mail-related resources.

### Added

- Monitor one or many mailboxes
- Optional, leveled logging using `rs/zerolog` package
  - JSON-format output
  - choice of `disabled`, `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info` (the
    default), `debug` or `trace`.
- TLS/SSL IMAP4 connectivity via `emerson/go-imap` package
- Go modules (vs classic `GOPATH` setup)

## [v0.1.0] - 2020-02-04

Initial release!

This release provides an early release version of a Nagios plugin used to
monitor IMAP mailboxes for content. This plugin (or its predecessor as of this
writing) is used to monitor email accounts scraped by our ticketing system.

Future releases of this project are expected to shift directory structure and
content in order to accommodate additional Nagios plugins and tools used to
monitor mail-related resources.

### Added

**TODO**: Source merged PR for specific packages/details

- Monitor one or many mailboxes
-Optional, leveled logging using `rs/zerolog` package
  - JSON-format output
  - choice of `disabled`, `panic`, `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info` (the
    default), `debug` or `trace`.
- TLS/SSL IMAP4 connectivity via `emerson/go-imap` package
- Go modules (vs classic `GOPATH` setup)
